Place the arrayFormatter.py file into the folder that contains the tape files you wish to process
and then run it.

Copy the formatted array declaration the python script prints to console and paste it at the
indicated line in the source.cpp file for the EveryTrade project.

You will need to edit the path to the NxCoreAPI.dll to match where you have it stored, and
run the project in x86 mode as the NxCoreAPI.dll does not like x64.
